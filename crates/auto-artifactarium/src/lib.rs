//! Parse network packets transmitted between the game and the server
//!
//! Packets are built up in following layers depending on the purpose of the packet:
//!
//! - Packets for connection management ([`GamePacket::Connection`])
//!     - **Ethernet/IP/UDP**, handled using [`etherparse`]
//!     - **[`ConnectionPacket`]**, containing events for connection establishment/disconnection
//! - Packets for game commands ([`GamePacket::Commands`])
//!     - **Ethernet/IP/UDP**, handled using [`etherparse`]
//!     - **KCP**, handled using [mhy-kcp](https://github.com/hashblen/mhy-kcp)
//!         - The KCP header contains an extra field that needs to be removed
//!           to be compatible with the regular KCP protocol
//!     - **[`GameCommand`]**, encrypted using XOR
//!     - **Protobuf**, payload, needs to be parsed into using the types generated in
//!       [`gen::protos`]
//!
//! [`GameCommand`]s are encrypted using an XOR-key.
//! One of the first packets sent is a request for a new key from a seed.
//! That key is used for the rest of the packets.
//! This means the recording for packets needs to start before the game starts (train hyperdrive).
//!
//! ## Trust boundary
//!
//! Everything below [`GameSniffer::receive_packet`] is attacker-reachable: the
//! caller hands over whatever landed on UDP 22101/22102, which any local process
//! or LAN host can write to. Nothing in a datagram is authenticated, so no
//! length, offset or connection event coming off the wire may be trusted to be
//! consistent, and none of them may panic the caller's capture thread.
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```
//! use auto_artifactarium::{GamePacket, GameSniffer, ConnectionPacket};
//!
//! let packets: Vec<Vec<u8>> = vec![/**/];
//!
//! let mut sniffer = GameSniffer::new();
//! for packet in packets {
//!     match sniffer.receive_packet(packet) {
//!         Some(GamePacket::Connection(ConnectionPacket::Disconnected)) => {
//!             println!("Disconnected!");
//!             break;
//!         }
//!         Some(GamePacket::Commands(commands)) => {
//!             for command in commands {
//!                 println!("{:?}", command);
//!             }
//!         }
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
