# Introduction

Irminsul is a utility to extract data from Genshin Impact and export it for use with [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/) and web sites, applications, and utilities that use the [GOOD](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/doc) data format.

Irminsul utilizes packet capture instead of the common optical character recognition (OCR) that other [scanners](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/scanner) use. This allows it to be much quicker in exchange for 1. needing to run with admin/root privaleges (for the packet capture) and 2. needing to be run when genshin starts to observe the handshake with the server.

## Dependencies

To use the `pcap` capture backend, make sure to install a Pcap library (Npcap/WinPcap on Windows, libpcap on Linux). The released Linux binary has libpcap linked into it, so this only applies there when building Irminsul yourself.

## Command line options

Irminsul accepts a handful of command line options for advanced use cases:

- `--capture-backend <pktmon|pcap>`: chooses which capture backend to use. On Windows both `pktmon` (default) and `pcap` are available. On other platforms only `pcap` is available.
- `--no-admin`: skips the automatic elevation prompt. This can be useful when you prefer to launch the application without requesting higher privileges up front.

## Features

In it's current state Irminsul supports:

- Incredibly fast capture of all Genshin Optimizer supported data
  - Artifacts including "unactivated" rolls and reporting of initial values for rolls
  - Weapons
  - Materials
  - Characters
- Simple, clean UI
- Export settings to filter which data gets exported
- Exports data either to the clipboard or saved to a file

Planned features include:

- Achievement export
- Wish history export
- Real time data updates while game is running

## Thanks

Irmunsil is built upon the work of many others.

- [PJK136](https://github.com/PJK136) whose work on a [fork of `stardb-exporter`](https://github.com/PJK136/stardb-exporter) provided the main inspiration for Irminsul's development.
- [juliuskreutz](https://github.com/juliuskreutz) whose [`stardb-exporter`](https://github.com/juliuskreutz/stardb-exporter) provided the foundation for PJK136's work as well as providing some examples for how to wrangle [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui).
- [hashblen](https://github.com/hashblen) whose [`auto-artifactarioum`](https://github.com/hashblen/auto-artifactarium) is used to interpret the network packets from Genshin.
- [IceDynamix](https://github.com/IceDynamix/) whose work on Honkai Star Rail network scanning is at the root of many of the Genshin and HSR network scanning utilities.
- [emmachase](https://github.com/emmachase) who wrote the packet capture library [`pktmon`](https://github.com/emmachase/pktmon) which Irminsul uses to allow packet capture without having to install a npcap driver as well as their contributions to some of the above projects.
- [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/) without which there would be no point in exporting data.
- [Inventory Kamera](https://github.com/Andrewthe13th/Inventory_Kamera) which was my introduction into artifact and character scanning and whose discord provided a collaboration environment that spawned Irminsul.
