# Introduction

Irminsul is a utility to extract data from Genshin Impact and export it for use with [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/) and web sites, applications, and utilities that use the [GOOD](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/doc) data format.

Irminsul utilizes packet capture instead of the common optical character recognition (OCR) that other [scanners](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/scanner) use. This allows it to be much quicker in exchange for 1. needing to run with admin/root privaleges (for the packet capture) and 2. needing to be run when genshin starts to observe the handshake with the server.

## Features

In it's current state Irminsul supports:

- Incredibly fast capture of all Genshin Optimizer supported data
  - Artifacts including "unactivated" rolls and reporting of initial values for rolls
  - Weapons
  - Materials
  - Characters
- Simple, clean UI
- Export settings to filter which data gets exported
- Exports data either to the clipboard or saved to a file

Planned features include:

- Achievement export
- Wish history export
- Real time data updates while game is running
